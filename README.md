The Company Management Platform is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline administrative tasks for businesses by providing a centralized platform for company registration, employee management, and file sharing. This versatile system empowers companies to efficiently manage their operations while adhering to subscription-based plans tailored to their needs.

Key Features:

Company Registration: Companies can easily register on the platform, providing essential details such as company name, industry, and contact information. Upon successful registration, each company is assigned a dedicated page within the platform.

Employee Management: Registered companies have the flexibility to add and manage their employees directly from their company page. They can assign roles, permissions, and access levels to each employee, ensuring efficient delegation of tasks and responsibilities.

Subscription Plans: The platform offers customizable subscription plans for companies, allowing them to choose a plan that aligns with their requirements. Subscription plans determine the number of employees that can be added to the company profile and the allocated storage space for file uploads.

File Management: Companies and employees can upload, organize, and share files securely within the platform. Subscription plans dictate the maximum file storage capacity for each company, ensuring optimal utilization of resources.

Access Control: Users have granular control over file access permissions, enabling them to designate who can view, edit, or download specific files. This feature enhances data security and confidentiality by restricting access to authorized personnel only.

Validation and Error Handling: The platform implements robust validation mechanisms and error handling procedures to maintain data integrity and ensure a seamless user experience. Input validation prevents erroneous data entry, while comprehensive error handling promptly addresses any unexpected issues that may arise during operation.
